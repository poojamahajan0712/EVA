# Assign10_EVA

Assignment: 

Pick your last code <br>
Make sure  to Add CutOut to your code. It should come from your transformations (albumentations) <br>
Use this repo: https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder (Links to an external site.) <br>
Move LR Finder code to your modules <br>
Implement LR Finder (for SGD, not for ADAM) <br>
Implement ReduceLROnPlatea: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau (Links to an external site.)<br>
Find best LR to train your model<br>
Use SDG with Momentum<br>
Train for 50 Epochs. <br>
Show Training and Test Accuracy curves<br>
Target 88% Accuracy.<br>
Run GradCAM on the any 25 misclassified images. Make sure you mention what is the prediction and what was the ground truth label.
