Assignment 7 -details 

#S7 
1.Copy_of_S7_try2.ipynb is the main file -training CIFAR 10 dataset.

2.Model1.py - CNN Model file being used .
model2.py -CNN model (with depthwise separable implementation)
( https://github.com/poojamahajan0712/EVA_Pooja/blob/master/S7_withdepthwise.ipynb )

3.train_iterations.py- for training the network
train_iterations1.py - with tqdm
4.test_score.py- for checking how model performs on test data (calculates accuracy)

5.class_wise_accuracy.py- checking class level accuracy 

Assignment8

Added two new modules - data_load_cifar10 - loading cifar data 
transform_func - for transformations
